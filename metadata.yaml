description: Along with the rest of his regiment, Sikh commander Ranjoor Singh is
  captured in the wake of a harrowing battle that unfolds in Flanders at the outset
  of World War I. The battlefield bravery of Singh and his men is equaled only by
  the ingenuity of their elaborate escape plans. Will the homesick crew ever make
  it back to India?
